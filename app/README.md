## Type Support For `.vue` Imports in TS

Since TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports, they are shimmed to be a generic Vue component type by default. In most cases this
is fine if you don't really care about component prop types outside of templates. However, if you wish to get actual prop types in `.vue` imports (for
example to get props validation when using manual `h(...)` calls), you can enable Volar's `.vue` type support plugin by
running `Volar: Switch TS Plugin on/off` from VSCode command palette.
